### Hi 👋, my name is André Assef, i'm from Brazil(BR). My life's purpose is defined by searching for a way to help the humanity be better through technologies. 
### In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with physics (🍺).
